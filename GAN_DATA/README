Description:
classification_train.txt and classification_test.txt are the image lists for car classifcation. The image names are listed in the order with the id of corresponding output node of the GoogLeNet model going from 0 to 430.
We use images from both classification_train.txt and classification_test.txt for training of attribute prediction.
attribute_test&verification_train.txt is the image list for testing of attribute prediction as well as training of verification models.
The image lists for testing of verification models are already included in the CompCars dataset.
